Their movements seemed well oiled and practiced, suggesting that they have done this trip many times before.\nYou see a soldier on break and walk up to him. “I saw the post in the market that asked for help. What would that entail?”\n\tThe soldier you spoke to grunted and pointed to a tent in the middle of the grounds, “The captain will be in there. Talk to him, and he’ll tell you everything you’ll need to know.”\n\tThanking him, you walk to the tent and brush aside a door flap. Inside, the room was spartan in nature; the only furniture was a single desk and chair with a single candle lighting the desk in which a heavy set man sat, squinting at a piece of parchment. You patiently wait a few minutes before he acknowledges you and looks up.\n\t“What do you want?”\n\tHis tone is rather brusque considering the fact that he had posted a notice asking for help, but you brush it off. Reading such small script in barely visible light would dour anyone’s day.\n\t“I’m here about the notice you posted about your upcoming journey. Do you have any further details such as what I’ll be doing or how long the trip is expected to take?”\n\tHe looks you up and down. “We’re looking for some extra protection. Know how to protect yourself?”\n\tYou shrug, “I grew up on a farm and had to constantly deal with wild animals. I’ve also had some training with spears and staves.”\n\tHe nodded. “The trip will take a couple days for both ways, mainly because of some heavy cargo. We don’t expect to meet any trouble, but you never know on the roads. We’ll be paying four copper for each day on the road. You will get paid two times, when we get to Pirn and when we get back, but at Pirn, you’ll get paid half the usual amount. Just incentive to come back with us. I don’t want to have to search for more men.”\n\t“Four copper a day?” You protest, “You’re asking me to risk my life for something barely enough to feed me for the day?”\n\t“We will be providing the grub and equipment for you to use. I think it to be fair compensation.”\n\tHe arches an eyebrow at you, awaiting your response.\n  "

His hands carefully rubbed an oiled cloth across the surface to prevent rust from taking hold.\n\tHe looks up at you while his hands never stop their movements.\n\t“The captain told me to report to you.”\n\tHe takes his time to look you over, judging the capabilities you have. Eventually, he nods, seemingly satisfied.\n“Take a seat by the others,” he nods towards a group of men. “Be ready for the order to set out.”\n\tYou walk to the group lounging around a campfire. Most of them seem like soldier material, judging from the more professional equipment surrounding them while two others look pretty similar you, with a spear and a matching gambeson. The two look pretty similar in appearance. Probably related somehow. You take a seat by them, taking the chance to introduce yourself.\n\t“I’m %s, you fellows new here as well?”\n\tThey take their turns shaking your hand. “Olli.” “Otti.”\n\tOlli tells you, “We’re brothers. Just looking to make some extra cash for family.”\n\tYou nod, “I’m just looking to see what’s outside this area. Get out of this town for once.”\n\tSuddenly, a bell rings across the camp. Everyone starts to put on armor and prepare to go. Lieutenant Arold comes over.\n\t“We’ll be taking the rear of the caravan. Olli, take the right. Otti, you’re on the left. %s, the back with me.

Though you had never left the town of Westwend, the scenery wasn’t that much different front what you saw on the road.\nThe captain hadn’t lied about the slow pace.

Still, you were got enough decent food and was going to get paid at the end so that wasn’t bad. Also, the information about the world you could pick up from the experienced soldiers was a goldmine.\nNonetheless, you got there at the end of the third day and set up camp with the others. Luckily for you, Lieutenant Arold announced that everyone will be able to take the next day off as the captain had business to attend to. You eventually make your way to the quartermaster to get paid your six copper. After adding that to your money pouch, you settle beside the fire to sleep for the night.\n"
